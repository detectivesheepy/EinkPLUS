# [Project Summary]
  This project is a mod of EinkPDA, which is a PDA powered by an ESP32-S3 running a custom "OS" written in C++ using the Arduino IDE. This project utilizes an E-Ink and OLED screen in tandem to mitigate the refresh rate restrictions of an E-Ink panel while retaining the aesthetics and benefits of using E-Ink. This project is a work in progress and currently amounts to a simple GUI for navigating between apps, a text (.txt) file editor, and a basic file manager. More applications are planned for the future and a list of TO-DOs can be found below.

I'm going to try and make some updates to it, like adding more functions, making it a little more funny, and more.

  This is built of of EinkPDA version 2.0 and may soon be outdated when new versions come out.

# Stuff i wanna add
